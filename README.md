# Start Escape Time Calculator
## About
This GitHub repository contains the source code that was used to create a Start Escape Time calculator, used to approximate the amount of time sailors have to escape submarines in dissabled submarine (DISSUB) scenarios. This project was developed as a part of a SEAP internship at the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL).
